# BeYourselfFilm

This is the product of my semester project for Web and User Interface Development. 

"Be Yourself" is a short film (currently in production) exploring the experience of first impressions in first dates and job interviews. The site is not live yet and the film is still in editing, so some content is dummy content. 

See the Design Document and Implementation Report for more detail about the design and development process.
